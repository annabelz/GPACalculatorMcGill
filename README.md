# GPACalculatorMcGill Project Story

I first started this project for personal use after taking an introductory Python programming course because I couldn't find an adequate GPA calculator online.
It simply takes the grades of the courses that you received/expect to receive this semester as well as the credits associated with each course and calculates your
term GPA, with the option to calculate the cumulative GPA if you input your current total of credits and cumulative GPA.

The code was very buggy and rudimentary as I hadn't put much thought into it and it was for personal use, but I recently revamped it by implementing a Java
GUI using the Swing library to make it more user-friendly and efficient. For the original Python code, if you wanted to calculate your term GPA based on 
an expected set of grades, you would have to restart the code each time you wanted to calculated a new set of grades for the same courses. Or, if you input
the grades in the wrong format, the program has no good way to fix this. The GUI streamlines this process by letting you select a grade from a dropdown list of
possible grades and calculates the GPA with the click of a button, which makes it easier to change grades for different calculations. The only thing you
need to input is the number of credits for each course. There's also no need to restart the program for new GPA calculations as the program is able to 
calculate any new set of grades by simply selecting a new grade and clicking the calculation button.

I try to work on this project whenever I get the time or feel the need to (ie. right after the exam season during the excruciating wait period for grades 
to be released) so there will no doubt be more updates in the future!
